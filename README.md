# Social Engineering Awareness Program

A production-ready, OOP‑driven Flask application that delivers interactive learning on social engineering threats, defenses, and incident response. The system provides a structured curriculum with knowledge checks, real‑world simulations, analytics, and certification.

Repository: [`clarkorcullo/Social-Engineering-Awareness`](https://github.com/clarkorcullo/Social-Engineering-Awareness)

## 🚀 Overview

This platform guides learners through seven modules and a final assessment, enforcing completion rules and offering realistic practice via simulations (Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting, Quid Pro Quo). It tracks progress, scores, time spent, and recent activity, and supports survey and certificate generation upon completion.

Key principles:
- Clean separation of concerns via a service layer (`business_services/`) and data models (`data_models/`).
- Content is code-first and versioned in `learning_modules/`.
- Simulations follow a Base → Concrete OOP pattern in `simulations/`.

## 🌐 Live Deployment

This project is live at [social-engineering-awareness.onrender.com](https://social-engineering-awareness.onrender.com/).

## 🎯 Core Features

### 📚 Learning Modules
- 7 comprehensive modules with practical examples and guidance
- Progressive unlocking: each module requires the previous one to be fully completed
- Knowledge checks per module with detailed feedback

### 🎮 Interactive Simulations
- Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting, Quid Pro Quo
- OOP design: `BaseSimulation` + specific implementations
- Real-time feedback with red‑flag explanations

### 📊 Assessment System
- Module Knowledge Checks: 5 questions/module, unlimited retakes
- Final Assessment: 25 questions, 3 retakes allowed every 48 hours
- Automatic grading, percentage computation, attempts tracking
- Recent activity feed (assessments, simulations, completions)

### 👤 User Management
- Registration with validation, secure authentication (Flask‑Login)
- Profile updates, avatars, and consistent progress tracking

### 📈 Analytics & Reporting
- Completion rate, average scores, simulations done, and time spent
- Survey and certificate unlocking based on completion rules

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
- **Architecture**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Design Patterns**: Service Layer, Repository Pattern, Factory Pattern

## ✅ Completion Rules (Access Control)
- A module is considered fully completed when:
  - Knowledge check score ≥ 80% (configurable) AND
  - Simulation completed when the module includes one (Modules 2–5)
- Modules unlock sequentially. Final Assessment unlocks only after all modules are completed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CapstoneProject
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Login with default admin credentials:
     - Username: `administrator`
     - Password: `Admin123!@#`

### Database Setup

The application automatically creates the database and loads content on first run. If you need to reload the module content:

```bash
python reload_modules.py
```

## 🧠 Content, Questions, and Simulations
- Edit learning content and questions in `learning_modules/`. Each module exposes content and a question factory.
- Simulations live in `simulations/` with a shared `BaseSimulation` API and per‑type logic.
- The app bootstraps modules and questions on first run and can be reloaded via `reload_modules.py`.

## 📋 Learning Modules

   - Basic concepts and psychology
   - Why social engineering works
   - Common targets and impacts

2. **Types of Social Engineering Attacks**
   - Phishing, pretexting, baiting
   - Quid pro quo and tailgating
   - Attack vectors and techniques

3. **Phishing Detection and Prevention**
   - Email phishing identification
   - Website spoofing detection
   - Prevention strategies

4. **Password Security and Authentication**
   - Strong password creation
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Security best practices

5. **Social Media Security**
   - Privacy settings and controls
   - Information sharing risks
   - Social media attack vectors

6. **Physical Security and Social Engineering**
   - Physical access control
   - Social engineering in person
   - Environmental security

7. **Incident Response and Reporting**
   - Incident detection
   - Response procedures
   - Reporting protocols

## 🧩 Architecture Notes
- `app.py` defines routes and wires services to templates.
- `data_models/` contains SQLAlchemy models (Users, Modules, Progress, Assessments, Simulations).
- `business_services/` encapsulates domain logic (assessment creation/validation, progress rules, analytics, simulations orchestration, user access checks).
- `templates/` are presentation-only; heavy logic is in services. The dashboard is fed by the `/dashboard` route.

## 📊 Dashboard Metrics
- Modules Completed vs Total Modules
- Simulations Completed
- Average Score (assessments)
- Time Spent (aggregated from progress)
- Final Assessment readiness, survey/certificate status, recent activities

## 🧪 Testing & Quality
- Service‑level boundaries make business logic testable in isolation.
- Templates avoid DB queries; data should be provided via routes.
